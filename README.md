# My-summer-in-markdown
**Introduction**

My name is Jeidam and I am in 10th grade. I like to play video games, watch anime, and listen to music.

**Summer activities**

I played games all summer I found a lot of new games that i like plating and enjoyed a lot. I got to chamnp in rocket league but lost it right after becasue i tried to help a friend rank up (i forgot about my alt account). I also went to the pool sometimes and went to Six Flags once.

**Summer Food**

During the summer I ate a lot of pizza. Pizza is one of my favorite food because it just has everything I like. Although, pizza is only good if its made right. I also ate a lot of ice cream. Ice cream is kind of the perfect summer treat as it is a very refreshing treat during such a hot and sweaty time.

This summer I listened to a lot of J-pop. I got into J-pop in the beginning of last semester and really got into it. J-pop artist just seem to alwaays find the right eay to make some the most amazing music I've ever heard. Specific artist that i listented to were Ado, ZUTOMAYO, and Creepy Nuts. All three have their won way of making J-pop music but it all just fits into a nice jamble of really good music.

**Most memorable experience**

The most memorablk experience I had this summer was the sad loss of Jaden Lee's phone.The phone had fallen into the water of the rid named Jet stream in Six Flags. It was a very tragic yet funny experience.
