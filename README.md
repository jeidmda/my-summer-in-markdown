**Introduction**

My name is Jeidam and I am in 10th grade. I like to play video games, watch anime, and listen to music.

**Summer activities**

I played games all summer I found a lot of new games that i like plating and enjoyed a lot. I got to chamnp in rocket league but lost it right after becasue i tried to help a friend rank up (i forgot about my alt account). I also went to the pool sometimes and went to Six Flags once.
